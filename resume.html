                <p class="text-center">
                    I’m a UI/UX designer who’s passionate about creating experiences that feel effortless and genuinely
                    useful.
                    I love digging into what makes users tick and turning that insight into clean, thoughtful design.
                    Whether I’m mapping out flows or fine-tuning visuals, I care about the little details that make a
                    big difference.
                    I thrive in collaborative spaces and enjoy finding simple solutions to complex problems.
