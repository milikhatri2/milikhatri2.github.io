                <p>This project addressed the dual challenge of food waste and food insecurity at NJIT and in the surrounding Newark community. The initiative proposed a pilot program to repurpose surplus food from the NJIT Gourmet Dining Services (GDS) to support the campus food pantry and local food banks. The effort combined sustainability, community impact, and logistical innovation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brand & User Research:</strong> I began with competitive research and visual
                            analysis of successful skincare and beauty websites. I also studied user behaviors around
                            online skincare shopping to identify key features like product education, clear
                            calls-to-action, and trust-building elements (e.g., ingredient transparency).</li>
                        <li><strong>Wireframing & Visual Design:</strong> Using Figma, I sketched multiple wireframes to
                            test content layout, hierarchy, and flow. I designed several iterations of the homepage,
                            product listing, and about pages—each refined through feedback from a supervisor with
                            experience in branding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> OI established a neutral color palette and paired it with
                            soft typography to reinforce the brand’s gentle, natural vibe. Consistent use of whitespace
                            and minimalistic design elements created a polished, high-end feel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usability & Accessibility:</strong> Ensured the design was accessible with legible
                            typography, contrast-checked elements, and a mobile-first approach. Visual hierarchy and
                            scannable content blocks were designed to help users quickly find what they need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback & Iteration:</strong> Throughout the process, I reviewed the design with a
                            project supervisor and made adjustments based on UX and visual feedback. This included
                            refining button placement, enhancing product visibility, and simplifying the navigation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <hr />
            </section>

            <hr class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
                The final design is a polished, user-friendly skincare website that balances aesthetics and clarity. The layout effectively introduces the brand and guides users through its product offerings. This project showcases my ability to work independently, implement feedback, and design a clean, functional digital product aligned with real-world brand goals.</p>
