                <p>This project addressed the dual challenge of food waste and food insecurity at NJIT and in the
                    surrounding Newark community. The initiative proposed a pilot program to repurpose surplus food from
                    the NJIT Gourmet Dining Services (GDS) to support the campus food pantry and local food banks. The
                    effort combined sustainability, community impact, and logistical innovation.</p>

                            <li>Conducted interviews with GDS management and
                                food pantry directors to understand the scale of food waste and food insecurity.</li>
                            <li>Identified operational inefficiencies, including GDS's lack of food waste tracking and
                                the
                                food pantry's limited resources despite growing demand.</li>
                            <li>Analyzed food insecurity data for New Jersey, highlighting the need for action within
                                the
                                NJIT community.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Food would be packaged in disposable, single-use containers to maintain hygiene and
                                    comply with health regulations.</li>
                                <li>Half of the leftovers would be delivered to NJIT’s food pantry, and the other half
                                    to local food banks like the Pierre Toussaint Food Pantry.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Proposed a weekly distribution schedule on Wednesdays, selected for high campus activity

                                support for bulk trays of leftovers.</li>
                            <li>Engaged the NJIT Honors College community to encourage volunteer participation through
